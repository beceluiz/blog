# Useful tools

### Drawio

Since i started learning Java again from beggining after a long time there some things i really forgot, but i really shouldn't forget these things, or sometimes i remember what it does, but not how it works.

But this time, i'm learning Java from DevDojo (on Youtube) and this guy is really a good professor with a phenomenal teaching skills, he just not show you how to use a method, or what something does, he show's you how it works behind the scenes.

I mean, almost everything that he's trying to teach and feel like it's becoming complicated to unterstand, he opens a diagram program and draws what is happening inside the program, how the computer understand what you are typing him to do it, and it's helping me a lot.

Now everytime i learn something new, i'm sketching it on draw.io to have a ilustrated idea of it. When i'm solving a problem aswell, i sketch it and next i start coding.

For example, on this imagem bellow, i was learning about multidimensional arrays and having some difficulties to understand how the loops are working through the arrays, and when i had to solve a problem i draw it first and then i could understand way better.

### ChatGPT

I know the IA came for help us, even though some Devs don't like it much, but i discovered this week some good thing you could use on the learning process.

scrolling through the comments of programming youtube videos, some guy said he's using gpt for generate code exercises.

At first i thought it's kinda weird because you have a lot of plataforms focused on this like Leetcode, Hackerrank, but i went test it and really helped me A LOT.

Since i'm learning Java from videos, after some topics, they have some exercises, but it's more general, like, one big exercise that will use 3-4 things that you learned, so i thought it would be great if i can pratice topic by topic.

So after every topic i learn, i tell GPT to generate 3 exercises for me to do, then after solve the exercises i paste the solution on GPT and ask for feedbacks, if i got it right and can fully understand i go to the next topic, if not, i tell GPT to generate 3 more untill i totally understand that topic.
