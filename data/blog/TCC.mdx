# TCC, Final Exams, Java Hiatus & I Love... CSS?

## What is a TCC?

In Brazil (where i'm live), when you are in the last year of college or technical courses (1+year), to graduate you need to make the TTC (Trabalho de ConclusÃ£o de Curso) what is like the Final Course Project in the college, that will englobe everything you had learning untill now, in the Computer Science courses correlateds like mine (Systems Development) in the most of cases you need to make a end-to-end Software, you'll have to apply theoretical knowledge to  solve real-world problems or to conduct a study that adds value to the discipline.

### Our TCC Project

I can't say much but me and my group (4 people) are developing a Study Plataform for college entrance exams. 

Basicly the TCC  need to have 3 versions, Web, Desktop and Android.

We are actually in the first version, the other 2 versions will be developed in the first semester of 2025.

#### Web Version Stack

The Web version is a fullstack website and the techs we have to use are:

Front-End:
- HTML
- CSS (just the pure version we can't use any frameworks like bootstrap, neither pre or post css (sass, style-components))
- Javscript (we have to use Jquery ðŸ’€)

Back-End:
- PHP (pure php, can't use any frameworks)

Data-base:

- MySQL

I really don't have big issues with the stack the want us to use, but the Jquery one pisses me off a little bit, it's a defased tech, these days, everybody is using React, Next.JS, Vue.JS, Svelte or Angular.

So i really think we should use the techs that are hot in the IT field right now, we can't act like React it's just a trend when it's the most used Javascript framework in the last 5 years.

And sometimes i rather to write things with the pure ES6 sintaxe than with JQuery, but it's ok.

#### Desktop Version Stack

All that i know for now, it's that we will need to use C#, and i really happy for that, i love coding in C#, it's my favorite language alongside Java.

#### Android Version Stack

To be honest, i don't know much about the Mobile Version too, but we will use Java or Kotlin on Android Studio (most-likey Java) because we learning Java on the Android Studio the whole year instead of Kotlin.


## Java Hiatus & I Love CSS?
I had to stop my Java study's for the last 2 weeks, because my group was late to send the web version to the teachers to avaliate, and i'm the only one in the group that was comfortable enough with the techs to develop the site from scretch so, i did.

My free time was 100% filled with HTML,JS, PHP and a lot of CSS ðŸ˜….

But i enjoyed it though, back in the days i was learning front-end, i did a lot of projects like that, and did a lot of bootcamps aswell but i always had a awkward feeling that i was not learning that much, because i used to watch the teacher making the code and doing with him at same time.
But now, When i'm coding the front-end by myself after a long time without touching it, i remember a lot of things from that time, specially the CSS, i could write it with grid and flexbox without much problem and could make it responsible aswell, so i was really happy when i finished.

But i really looking foward to the next year where we'll start the Mobile App and i will lock in myself on Java 200%.

#### Database Modeling
So, before we started to implement the SQL and the physical database, we first had to design the Database Model.

Starting with the ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram), I had some questions envolving cardinality but i could clear my mind after revise my Database class notes.

After that, i did the ERM (Entity-Relationship Model), that one was easier to make to be honest, but that's the part i did more mistakes tho ðŸ˜….

Sadly i couldn't be present to receive the feedback in the deadline day, So my group take it and they had did pass it to me, I'm working to fix what was wrong and implement the suggestions the Professor made, but i was happy doing the Database Model, i think i really learned a lot from that.

## Final Exams
I will have my final exams of the year in the next weeks and after that my vacation is gonna start.

Now i finished the firs of TCC I'm  studying and doing pratices exercices of the disciplines (Mobile, Database, Web Development, System Development, Embedded Systems).

And now i'm back studying Java alongside with it, I hope i'll do well in the exams and i'll be back with updates.
