# The Blog

### Why i made this blog?

First of all, i made this blog because i need to write about my project,
 in the next two years i will focus myself on learning java and english to get a Remote International Job.

 ## Why Java?

 I want to become a Back-End Developer and i'm choosing Java, for 3 reasons:
1. People Arround Me:
I have some friends that already have years of experience working as Java Deveolopers and them can help me with the language, they can also guide me, give tips and do some code reviews, basicaly work as a mentor.
2. High Skill Ceiling: Java is probably the most difficult programming language to learn, the celling is high, so if you learn java well, you probably will can learn any other programming language easier.
3. Jobs: I know lately the bar to get your first job as a Developer is higher than ever, and Java still is one of the most demanded Programming Languages of tech field.

Also Java was my favorite Programming language back in college and also now on the technical school.

## English?

Yes. I am Brazillian and a Portuguese Native-Speaker, to get a International job i
will need to improve my english skills a lot, To be honest,
 i don't think my english is bad, i can understand well almost everything a native speaker
is saying and i can read/write too, but i miss the mainly: The Speak Part, I don't have opportunities to use english on my Work or School,
 So it's not a immersive experience but i will work hard to improve my english anyway.
I have pretty sure that write all these blog posts in english talking about my learning experiences will help a lot on it.
